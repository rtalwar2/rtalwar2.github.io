                    <p class="text-faded mb-4" style="text-align: center;">My name is Raman and I'm a master's student of information engineering technology. I'm currently about to finish my thesis, which is about using XAI techniques to discover feature contaminations in IDS datasets for improved Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection🤯.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>While I usually answer "something with computers" when someone asks me what I study, that's not my only interest, I also like eating, travelling, movies, doing random stuff, completing my bucket list, photosynthesis (no, I'm not a plant),...<br><br>I've been fortunate to have received numerous opportunities to develop myself in both technical and non-technical ways.&nbsp;For instance, I embarked on a mini Erasmus experience with the ENLIGHT University to Groningen. Additionally, I participated in the Open Summer of Code as a student in 2022, I was selected to enroll in the one-year 'Innovation for Society' excellence program at Ghent University, I've also been a delegate of the European Youth Parliament (EYP) Belgium.&nbsp;<br><br>When I'm not studying or writing my thesis, you can find me following interesting online courses like part 2 of the course "Practical Deep Learning for Coders 2022" from Fasi.ai (part 1 was awesome, I really recommend it), watching Binging with Babish and hoping I'll ever be able to cook like him, or trying to find new ways to make my tea taste better.<br><br>So, yeah, that's me in a nutshell. If you want to know more, feel free to hit me up, my contacts are at the bottom of the page 😉.&nbsp;</p><a class="btn btn-light btn-xl" role="button" href="#projects">projects</a>

                        <p>This all started with one of my best friends who challenged me for a robot fight. We both had to make a robot by the end of summer and compete in a competition.<br><br>The rules are simple:<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;No manual intervention.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We must build a robot which we can control (autopilot is also a possibility but a little complex)&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;All types of electronics are allowed.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;We must design our own weapons and can 3D print them.&nbsp;<br>For my robot I used a servo motor and a stepper motor as actuators. My controller was a simple joystick and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. Now the most important part, the weapons, for my weapons I used items&nbsp;I could find at home. Eventually I ended up using sparkle sticks firework as my main weapon. I made my own ignition system using thin pencil graphite and four 9V batteries. And as a little extra I also included an inversely polarized capacitor. Sadly, my robot lost, but I had a lot of fun developing it and I learned a lot about working with hardware and controlling it with my own software. We had so much fun, that we organize it every summer now.</p>

                        <p>One of my biggest projects I worked alone on was Cloudy, a smart Cloud Lamp. I made it as my final project in my very first year as a college student. I chose to make a smart lamp in the shape of a cloud.&nbsp;<br><br>The lamp had electronics in it and a little raspberry pi. The raspberry pi ran a webserver with a database that hosted an interactive website. The website was made using HTML/CSS/JS and used the openWeatherMapsAPI. On the website you can see weather reports of your chosen locations. The color of the lamp adapts to the weather of the selected location.&nbsp;<br>The lamp supports five different weather modes:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;sunny<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;snow<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;rain<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;cloudy<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;partially cloudy<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;stormy&nbsp;<br>There is also a microphone built in so you can change the location of the cloud with two claps. And the LCD display shows you the location of the lamp and the weather description. You can see a little demonstration of the claps here.<br><br>It has sensors to measure the indoor air quality. It measures:<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;CO2 concentration (in ppm)<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Relative humidity (in %)<br><br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature (in °C)<br><br>And an alarm (Red and Blue lights) is triggered in case the air quality was too bad.</p><img src="assets/img/cloudy2.png"><img src="assets/img/cloudy.png">

The objective of the project was to design and implement a system that could handle a high volume of requests and handle them efficiently.<br><br>To achieve this goal, me and my team decided to use the Kafka message queue for asynchronous communication between the services and REST for synchronous communication. This allowed us to decouple the services and ensure that each service could handle its own workload without being affected by the performance of other services.<br><br>We also used a NoSQL database for each service, which allowed us to scale the database easily and handle large amounts of data.&nbsp;<br><br>Throughout the project, I learned a lot about systems design and building a microservice application. I gained experience in working with the Quarkus framework, Kafka, and REST, as well as NoSQL databases.<br><br>Overall, this project was a great learning experience and helped me to understand the importance of designing a system that can handle a high volume of requests and how to achieve that by using microservices and message queues.</p>
